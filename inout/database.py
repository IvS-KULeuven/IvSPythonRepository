A simple interface to work with a database saved on the hard disk.

class Database(dict):
    
    '''
    A database class.
    
    The class creates and manages a dictionary saved to the hard disk. 
    
    It functions as a python dictionary with the extra option of synchronizing
    the database instance with the dictionary saved on the hard disk. 
    
    No changes will be made to the hard disk copy, unless Database.sync() is 
    called.
    
    Note that changes made on a deeper level than the (key,value) pairs of the 
    Database (for instance in the case where value is a dict() type itself) 
    will not be automatically taken into account when calling the sync() 
    method. The key for which the value has been changed on a deeper level has 
    to be added to the Database.__changed list by calling addChangedKey(key)
    manually.
    
    Running the Database.sync() method will not read the database from the hard
    disk if no changes were made or if changes were made on a deeper level 
    only. In order to get the most recent version of the Database, without 
    having made any changes, use the .read() method. Note that if changes were 
    made on a deeper level, they will be lost.
    
    Example:
    
    >>> import os
    >>> from ivs.inout import database
    >>> filename = 'mytest.db'
    >>> db = database.Database(filename)
    No database present at mytest.db. Creating a new one.
    >>> db['test'] = 1
    >>> db['test2'] = 'robin'
    >>> db.sync()
    >>> db2 = database.Database(filename)
    >>> print db2['test']
    1
    >>> print db2['test2'] 
    robin
    >>> db2['test'] = 2
    >>> db2.sync()
    >>> db.sync()
    >>> print db['test']
    1
    >>> db.read()
    >>> print db['test']
    2
    >>> del db2['test2']
    >>> db2.sync()
    >>> print db['test2']
    robin
    >>> db.read()
    >>> print db['test2']
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    KeyError: 'test2'
    >>> test_dict = dict()
    >>> db['test'] = test_dict
    >>> db.sync()
    >>> db2.read()
    >>> print db2['test']
    {}
    >>> db['test']['test'] = 1
    >>> db.sync()
    >>> db2.read()
    >>> print db2['test']
    {}
    >>> db.addChangedKey('test')
    >>> db.sync()
    >>> db2.read()
    >>> print db2['test']
    {'test': 1}
    >>> db.setdefault('test','defkey')
    {'test': 1}
    >>> db.setdefault('test3','defval')
    'defval'
